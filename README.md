## üöÄ Getting Started

To get OptimCV up and running on your local machine, follow these detailed steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

*   **Python 3.x**: We recommend Python 3.9 or newer for optimal compatibility.
*   **pip**: The Python package installer, usually comes bundled with Python.
*   **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database system. Ensure it's installed and running, and you have created a database and a user for OptimCV.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**: First, clone the OptimCV repository from GitHub to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ademdev12/OptimCV.git
    cd OptimCV
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment**: It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. This isolates your project's dependencies from other Python projects.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment**: Activate the newly created virtual environment:

    *   **On macOS/Linux**:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    *   **On Windows**:

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies**: With your virtual environment activated, install all required Python packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set up environment variables**: Create a new file named `.env` in the `backend/` directory. This file will store sensitive information and configuration settings. Populate it with the following variables, replacing the placeholder values with your actual keys and settings:

    ```
    SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key_here
    DEBUG=True
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_public_key
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_generative_ai_api_key
    ```

    *   `SECRET_KEY`: A unique, long, and random string used by Django for cryptographic signing. You can generate one using online tools or Python code.
    *   `DEBUG`: Set to `True` for development purposes (enables detailed error pages). **MUST be `False` in production!**
    *   `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your secret and public API keys from your Stripe dashboard. These are essential for processing payments.
    *   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your API key for accessing Google Generative AI services. Obtain this from the Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Console.

### Database Setup

1.  **Configure your database**: Open `backend/settings.py` and update the `DATABASES` setting to connect to your PostgreSQL database. Replace the placeholder values with your database credentials:

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'OptimCV_db',  # Your database name
            'USER': 'your_db_user',  # Your database username
            'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',  # Your database password
            'HOST': 'localhost',  # Or your database host
            'PORT': '',  # Leave empty for default, or specify port
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Apply database migrations**: Run the following commands to create the necessary database tables and apply any pending migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

3.  **Create a superuser (optional)**: To access the Django administration panel, create a superuser account:

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to set up your username, email, and password.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Django development server**: Once all the above steps are completed, you can start the local development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

2.  **Access the application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the OptimCV application.
